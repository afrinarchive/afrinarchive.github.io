The Workflow

Run these four scripts sequentially after you've written or updated your village information in the Markdown (.md) files.

1.  md_to_html_villages.py
    * Purpose: This is the first and most important step. It takes your detailed Markdown files and uses the template to build all the individual HTML pages for each village.

2.  make_village_list.py
    * Purpose: After the individual pages are created, this script scans them to automatically generate the master list file (00_names_nahiyas.md). - the may no longer be necessary?

3.  00_village_names_creator.py
    * Purpose: This script reads the master list from the previous step to build the main Village Directory webpage (00_village_names.html) that links to everything.

4.  make_graph.py (Version 1)
    * Purpose: This script scans the village HTML pages created in Step 1 to find all the internal links and generates the single graph-data.json file needed for the interactive graph on your index.html landing page.
