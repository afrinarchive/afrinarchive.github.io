                <div class="p-4 prose max-w-none"><p><strong>1. Efrîn, city of Afrin, 47108/ - (210 – 340m):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Afrin: is the name of the Afrin River, and it was given to the city after its establishment at the beginning of the twentieth century. We have found the name &quot;Afrin&quot; in its current form in four historical sources from the Islamic eras, which are: [History of Aleppo - by al-Uthmani, p. 478, events of the year 1085 AD. And Subh al-A&#x27;sha by al-Qalqashandi, p. 57. And al-Durr al-Muntakhab by Ibn al-Shihna, p. 167. And Mu&#x27;jam al-Buldan by Yaqut al-Hamawi, the second part, p. 180]. Thus, the oldest record of the name &quot;Afrin&quot; in its current form dates back to the year 1085 AD. However, none of these sources have touched upon the meaning of the name &quot;Afrin&quot; or its origin. We will search here for the origin and meaning of (Afrin), and mention some opinions regarding it:</li>
</ul>
<p>1- &quot;Afrin&quot; in Arabic dictionaries and sources:</p>
<p>It is stated in &quot;al-Qamus al-Muhit&quot; that &quot;Afar: means turbid with what is mixed with it of color, and the thing is considered turbid: i.e., it is mixed with dust.&quot;</p>
<p>And it is stated in the dictionary &quot;Lisan al-Arab&quot;: Ufrin means &quot;dusty,&quot; and it is said that it is the lion. It is said, for example: Laithu Ufrin (a lion of Ufrin).</p>
<p>As for Khayr al-Din al-Asadi, he says: that the word Afrin means dust. He quotes from al-Abshilihi: that it means dust /vol. 5, p. 413/. Abdallah al-Helou asks about that and says: (Was the region distinguished by the abundance of its dust to be so named? The reality is that there is no such explanation). p. 396). But it seems that Mr. al-Helou was not aware that the Afrin region is rich in water, rugged terrain, and antiquities, and that its dust is only mentioned very rarely.</p>
<p><strong>2- Afrin in Assyrian and Greek Texts:</strong></p>
<p>An Assyrian text dating back to the year 876 BC mentions that the river Aprie flows through the plain of Patin (1). The famous Greek historian &quot;Strabo&quot; also mentions the name of the Afrin River in the same form, &quot;Aprie,&quot; in the first century BC.</p>
<p>The historians have agreed that the origin of the word Apre is from the Lician language, which is one of the Indo-European (Aryan) languages, ancient in Asia Minor. The basic form of the word is: Eple (2). As we know, the root -Ap in the ancient Aryan languages, including Kurdish, means: water. The Kurds, according to their dialects, change the letter p to v, so it becomes Av. The word has remained in the Indian subcontinent in its ancient form in terms of pronunciation and meaning, but it is not pronounced as Ab or Ap, meaning &quot;water,&quot; like the name &quot;Punjab,&quot; which is composed of two syllables: Pênc, meaning five, and Ap, meaning water. Due to the absence of the letter P in the Arabic language, it was replaced by the letter &quot;F,&quot; just as the letter Alif was replaced by the letter &quot;ع,&quot; and thus the first syllable of that word became &quot;Af&quot; instead of -Ap.</p>
<p>As for the syllable re-, it is the first syllable of the old Kurdish word &quot;Riwîn,&quot; meaning &quot;the reddish clay.&quot; It is said <em>Bizina rwîn</em> &quot;the goat with the reddish color,&quot; or &quot;the reddish clay-colored goat.&quot; It is also said <em>Ava riwîn</em> &quot;the water with the reddish color&quot; or &quot;the reddish clay-colored water.&quot; By combining the two words: Av (water) and Riwîn (the reddish clay), a new name is formed, which is Avariwîn or Avriwîn, &quot;Afa Riwîn or Afriwîn.&quot; As can be observed, it is almost identical in form to the word &quot;Afrin&quot; and means &quot;the water of the reddish clay.&quot; This is a known characteristic of the Afrin River during its major floods. The elders from the inhabitants of the region in the northern villages still pronounce the name Afrin in the form of &quot;Efrîn.&quot; This is a word that refers to the remnants of plants and the reddish clay loam that floats on the surface of the river during its flood.</p>
<p>As for taking the root rê- or lê- – in its other Kurdish meaning, i.e., &quot;course, path, or way&quot; – the full name would be &quot;the course of the water or the stream of the water.&quot;</p>
<p>Footnote 1: Encyclopedia of Aleppo... Khayr al-Din al-Asadi, the first part, page 172.</p>
<p>Footnote 2: This syllable is mentioned in the manuscript &quot;The Dialects in Afrin - Mamad Jamo,&quot; who is a researcher in the languages of the East.</p>
<p><strong>3- Afirîn:</strong></p>
<p>A Kurdish word meaning creation and giving. The Afrin River with its flowing water was and still is a source of life and giving. It spreads life on its banks for hundreds of villages and cities. It is a source of giving to the thirsty, as if the Kurds named the river &quot;the giver of life and fertility,&quot; Afirîn, just as they name a woman &quot;Afret,&quot; the creator of life.</p>
<p>While the meaning of the name and its origin may be, the predecessors of the Kurds from the Hurrians and Medes have been present for a long time in the Taurus Mountains regions, for a period that began before the Common Era. It also spread on the banks of the Afrin River since its source to its mouth in hundreds of ancient Kurdish villages. The Kurds and their ancestors were a sedentary people who knew the river by several names, Aprie, Afrin, or Afirîn. And despite all that, the definitive knowledge of the origin of some of the ancient names remains a matter of great difficulty.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sources indicate that in the Roman era, a Roman &quot;fast&quot; road passed through the location of the city of Afrin. The excavations for the buildings on the sides of the Jinderes road street have revealed finely carved archaeological stones and large clay jars, which indicates an ancient settlement at the site. It is also mentioned that there were mills and ancient caves north of the old building of the electricity company, which were used in ancient times by travelers, as evidenced by the ancient monetary coins that appear in their soil.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>History books mention that in the Middle Ages - around the fourteenth century AD - there was a bridge at the location of the city named &quot;Qibbar.&quot; In the late Ottoman era, there were several inns for accommodating convoys and travelers north of the current bridge near the aforementioned caves.</li>
</ul>
<p>The city of Afrin consists of the following neighborhoods:</p>
<p><strong>The Old Town:</strong> Construction began on the official buildings and administrative offices of the city, such as the police station, the prison, and the serai, at the beginning of the French Mandate period, and their construction was completed between the years 1925 and 1930. During that time, the Jinderes road street was established, and on its sides, shops and small hotels were built.</p>
<p>As for the first inhabitants of the city, they were Kurds from the village of Kirsan, and some Armenians who were loyal to the French forces in the face of Ottoman oppression. Then the construction of houses was joined by some of the region&#x27;s aghas from the aghas of Ghaybari, Sheikh Ismail, Sayyid Mimo, Ahmed Khalil Agha, and Dliwarush Agha, the leaders of the Yazidis...</p>
<p>and Afrin remained a small town until the late sixties of the twentieth century. Its few houses spread on the slope of the mountain with a coordinated and beautiful form, and most of them were of stone and covered with wood and one floor.</p>
<p>After that date, the town witnessed a great urban expansion due to the intense local migration to it, and large new neighborhoods were formed, which are known popularly as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Al-Mahmudiyya Neighborhood:</strong> It is in the northwest of the city and is named after Mahmoud Qadib al-Ban, who was the first to build houses for residence there in the early seventies of the twentieth century.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Al-Zaydiyya Neighborhood:</strong> It is in the north and is the old village of Zaydan. Its inhabitants were a mixture of Kurds, Arabs, and Christians loyal to some of the Aleppine and European families and the French (1) on the plain adjacent to the city of Afrin from the west. This neighborhood has extended northward to the summit of the Xemrevîn mountain. The inhabitants of this neighborhood are a mixture of Kurds, Arabs, and Christians. As for the name, it is attributed to the shrine of &quot;Sheikh Zayd&quot; located within the neighborhood&#x27;s graveyard on the summit of the mountain.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Al-Ashrafiyya Neighborhood:</strong> A new neighborhood located east of the river on the Empêlk plateau, which is adjacent to the Afrin river. This neighborhood was founded in the late sixties of the twentieth century. Its first inhabitants were from &quot;Wahidê Aşvan&quot; (Wahid al-Tahan) from the village of Kafr Batra. A large neighborhood with its simple houses scattered over the entire western slope of the Empêlk mountain. Its inhabitants are mostly migrants from the villages of the region, and most of them work in agricultural jobs. This neighborhood is considered the belt of poverty for the city of Afrin.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Qeracî Gênco Taxa (Qaraj Kenjo Neighborhood):</strong> It is located in the south of the city, in the southern part of the Empêlk plateau. The neighborhood is named after its land owner &quot;Kenjo Agha,&quot; and some of its inhabitants now call it the &quot;Tariq Turendeh neighborhood&quot; due to its location on the old Turendeh road. The first to build houses for residence there was the Tayyib family &quot;Huryak&quot; around the year 1973. The site of the neighborhood contains ruins of buildings of a military barracks for the English army that date back to the Second World War period.</li>
</ul>
<p>Its houses spread out in a sprawling manner on the western slope of the adjacent mountain to the Afrin River, taking a north-south extension, extending to the village of Turendeh, which itself was annexed to the administrative boundaries of the city of Afrin.</p>
<p>Footnote 1: Most of those lands belonged to &quot;Madame Salha,&quot; the wife of the Italian consul in Aleppo, and the Yazidi Kurds still curse her name in their songs for her cruelty, and her stone house is near the Saray of Afrin, which was demolished in 1999 and a three-story building was built in its place.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Al-Bubna Neighborhood:</strong> A small street adjacent to the western bank of the Afrin River upon its arrival in the city. Most of its inhabitants are from the Arab al-Bubna, and it was a cattle market.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Al-Autostrad Neighborhood:</strong> It is located west of the city, and it is a modern neighborhood with beautiful multi-story buildings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The city of Afrin is the capital of Jabal al-Kurd and the main center for its economic, social, and administrative activity. It is a beautiful, quiet city with a distinct geographical location and a pleasant climate. The Syrian Geographical Dictionary says of it that it is one of the most beautiful small cities in Syria.</p>
<p>The construction movement began to be active in the city of Afrin in the last decades of the twentieth century. Its buildings rose and a number of good and diverse commercial shops were established. It now has a daily market for agricultural and animal products, in addition to the weekly Wednesday market and another cattle market.</p>
<p>There are in the city and its vicinity a number of olive presses, factories for the production of <em>birin</em> (olive pomace), and soap, and others for building materials, some food materials, a workshop for beverages, and mills for flour... And its number has increased to a number of doctors, pharmacies, and shops for tailoring, blacksmithing, carpentry, and the maintenance of instruments and vehicles, in addition to four private hospitals. Due to the settlement of tens of thousands of the region&#x27;s sons in Aleppo, there is a permanent and heavy transportation movement to and from it.</p>
<p>The population of the city of Afrin, according to the estimates of its municipality in 2006, reached about 84,000 people (see the first chapter of the book).</p>

Her River and Green Hills</span> by the writer Abdulrahman Mohammed from the village of Qatmah</p>
<p>Afrin: Located in the northwestern corner of <span class="internal-link">Syria</span>. Afrin took its name from the word &quot;Afro&quot;, which in <span class="internal-link">Aramaic</span> means fertile land and is located at the southern slope of <span class="internal-link">Mount Zawiya</span> at an elevation of 392 meters above sea level and on the elevated right bank of the <span class="internal-link">Afrin River</span>, which keeps it safe from river flooding. It is connected by a fertile civilization and is 60 km northwest of the city of <span class="internal-link">Aleppo</span>. It is bordered to the north by the highlands and farms of Mount Zawiya and the village of <span class="internal-link">Tell Tawil</span>. To the south by the plain and Afrin River and the village of <span class="internal-link">Karsan Tash</span>, and to the east by the Afrin River valley and the <span class="internal-link">Aleppo-Afrin</span> road and the village of <span class="internal-link">Arshqibar</span>.</p>
<p>To the west lies the fertile agricultural plain and the villages of <span class="internal-link">Kafr Shiel</span> and <span class="internal-link">Maarata</span>. The history of Afrin dates back to the beginning of the twentieth century when in 1925 the site of <span class="internal-link">Arshqibar Bridge</span> was chosen to build a government house, which was the beginning of the establishment of Afrin city to become an administrative center for managing the region, as it organizationally attracted the surrounding areas and the administrative center was transferred from the village of <span class="internal-link">Maabatli</span> and Maarata to Afrin city to become the final administrative center for the region. Afrin was a place for commercial caravans to rest between Aleppo and <span class="internal-link">Alexandretta Province</span>. The city expanded after independence and incorporated some neighboring villages. Its old houses are made of stone and clay with flat wooden roofs. The city expanded during the correction era and regulatory plans were prepared to include 830 hectares. Modern concrete multi-story buildings began to spread around the old city core and on both sides of its modern streets, and new neighborhoods were established such as <span class="internal-link">Al-Ashrafiyya</span> neighborhood east of the city and <span class="internal-link">Al-Mahmoudiyya</span> neighborhood northwest of the city. Afrin city is considered one of the most beautiful small cities in the <span class="internal-link">Syrian Arab Republic</span> in terms of street organization since the <span class="internal-link">French era</span>. The inhabitants of this city work in agriculture, most importantly olives, grains, legumes, and vineyards. As for irrigated crops, they are watered from the Afrin River waters and artesian wells. The people also grow summer vegetables near the Afrin River, cotton, and sugar beet irrigated from the Afrin River. Most of its inhabitants depend, in addition to their agricultural resources, on what professional work, services, and commercial exchanges bring, and some of them work in state institutions. It has an electricity network and drinking water drawn from the <span class="internal-link">Kafr Jannah</span> spring northeast of Afrin about 7 km away and from artesian wells. It has several elementary, preparatory, and secondary schools, an industrial secondary school, and a Sharia preparatory school. Its population is about 47,108 thousand people, and the total population of the <span class="internal-link">Central District</span> is 136,873 people as of 1/1/2006. It has a cultural center, rural development center, health and veterinary centers, a post, telegraph and telephone center, a childhood care center, a guidance unit for carpet and rug making industry, in addition to official government departments. There are several mosques, the oldest being <span class="internal-link">Salah al-Din Mosque</span> near the government house. There are 11 sesame oil extraction factories, five olive oil presses, four small soap factories, and a tin plate factory. The <span class="internal-link">Afrin Market (Bazaar)</span> was also established during the era of <span class="internal-link">Jamil Ahmed Bafi Agha</span>, mayor of Afrin in 1935, where a bazaar is held every Wednesday in the city center. A city council was established in Afrin city in 1983 with ten members. Afrin is connected to Aleppo city by two paved roads: the first <span class="internal-link">Afrin-Deir al-Jamal-Aleppo</span> and the second <span class="internal-link">Afrin-Darat Azza-Aleppo</span>. Among the first inhabitants were the <span class="internal-link">Armenians</span> who fled from <span class="internal-link">Turkish</span> persecution and built their homes around the government buildings, and worked in blacksmithing and other trades that the <span class="internal-link">French forces</span> needed, especially in horse equipment preparation.</p>
<p>Then some regional leaders joined in building residential houses, such as <span class="internal-link">Al Sido Mimi</span>, <span class="internal-link">Al Ghabari</span>, and the leader of the <span class="internal-link">Yazidis</span> at that time <span class="internal-link">Darwish Agha Shamo</span>, then <span class="internal-link">Ahmed Khalil</span> from <span class="internal-link">Oshaghli Factory</span> and others.</p>
<p><strong>Afrin</strong></p>
<p>An administrative region in <span class="internal-link">Mountain of the Kurds</span> belonging to Aleppo Governorate, extending eastward to <span class="internal-link">Mount Simaan</span>. It is bordered to the north by <span class="internal-link">Turkey</span>, to the east by <span class="internal-link">Azaz</span> city, to the south by <span class="internal-link">Mount Simaan</span> region and <span class="internal-link">Idlib Governorate</span>, and to the west by <span class="internal-link">Alexandretta Province</span>. It consists of Afrin city and seven districts: (<span class="internal-link">Central Afrin villages</span>, <span class="internal-link">Bulbul</span>, Jindires, Rajo, <span class="internal-link">Sharan</span>, <span class="internal-link">Sheikh al-Hadid</span>, <span class="internal-link">Maabatli</span>) and a total of 263 villages and 100 farms.</p>
<p><strong><span class="internal-link">Afrin River</span></strong></p>
<p>The <span class="internal-link">Afrin River</span> is located northwest of <span class="internal-link">Syria</span>, in the Afrin region of Aleppo Governorate. It originates from <span class="internal-link">Mount Lukkam</span> and the <span class="internal-link">Antab plateau</span> and passes through <span class="internal-link">Rondan</span>. The length of its course in Syrian territory is 85 km out of its total original length of 149 km from its source to its end in the <span class="internal-link">Amq Depression</span> in <span class="internal-link">Alexandretta Province</span>.</p>
<p>It penetrates Syrian territory northeast of <span class="internal-link">Shaltah</span> village at an elevation of 360 m and passes near <span class="internal-link">Deir Sawan</span> village after <span class="internal-link">Shaltah</span>, crossing the <span class="internal-link">Roman bridges</span> erected on this river. It meets the <span class="internal-link">Saboun River</span> west of <span class="internal-link">Vira Kan</span> village and heads deep toward <span class="internal-link">Midanki</span> where the multiple hard rocks form waterfalls in its course in <span class="internal-link">Midanki</span> and <span class="internal-link">Kumruk</span>, penetrating the land with many bends until Afrin city. Several streams and small springs feed it and form many bends that descend to it from the heights of <span class="internal-link">Mount Simaan</span> and <span class="internal-link">Lilon</span> to the east and <span class="internal-link">Mount Akrad</span> to the west. With an average flow of 8.6 m³/sec, and in spring the flow reaches 15.6 m³/sec, sometimes causing destructive floods as happened in 1974 when the main bridge at the entrance to Afrin city completely collapsed and a replacement bridge was built. The river waters decrease and become scarce in summer, reaching a flow of 1.41 m³/sec. To regulate the river waters and benefit from its waters, the state was interested in building a dam on the river course called the <span class="internal-link">Seventeenth of April Dam</span>. The foundation stone was laid in 1980 by <span class="internal-link">Dr. Abdul Raouf Qasim</span>, former Prime Minister, to build a large dam on the river course north of Afrin city at the <span class="internal-link">Midanki</span> site. The dam lake extends eastward for about 12 km. This dam is located north of Afrin city at <span class="internal-link">Midanki</span> village and was inaugurated in 2004 by Prime Minister <span class="internal-link">Engineer Mohammed Naji Atri</span>. It will benefit from the river waters for irrigation and reclamation of an average number of hectares in the Afrin and Jindires plain up to the <span class="internal-link">Turkish borders</span>. Several bridges are also built on it west of <span class="internal-link">Midanki</span> near the <span class="internal-link">Kumruk waterfalls</span>. There are two bridges in Afrin city: the first at the site of the old collapsed bridge and the second 500 m south. There is also a third bridge at <span class="internal-link">Kafir</span> village and <span class="internal-link">Birj Abdul Walaw</span>, and a fourth bridge at <span class="internal-link">Tell Salur</span> village.</p>
<p>The <span class="internal-link">Afrin River</span>, especially after the establishment of the <span class="internal-link">Seventeenth of April Dam</span>, is considered the vital and important artery of the region and forms a tourist outlet for <span class="internal-link">Aleppo</span> city. Its river waters are also drawn to irrigate Afrin and <span class="internal-link">Azaz</span> cities at present.</p>
<p><strong><span class="internal-link">Afrin Municipality</span></strong></p>
<p>In 1926, the administrative center of the region moved from <span class="internal-link">Maabatli</span> village, and until 1927 the new Afrin municipality was established where the number of its houses was limited.</p>
<p>The first mayor of Afrin municipality from 1926 to 1930 was <span class="internal-link">Mr. Jamil Ahmed Agha Bafi</span> from <span class="internal-link">Qatmah</span> village (Afrin region), where the municipality developed with its limited capabilities. A house was built for the municipality next to the government house near the old Afrin bazaar until the sixties of this century. Due to the expansion of the city size, especially toward the north and west on the <span class="internal-link">Zaydiyya-Rajo</span> road and on the Jindires road <span class="internal-link">Alexandretta Province</span> street, and during the glorious correction era, the city area reached 830 hectares. A regulatory plan was then developed for it, including attention to irrigation and drainage networks, telephone, electricity, and water. A center for rural development, guidance unit, and health centers were also established. Several new neighborhoods were also created on the eastern side of Afrin city on the <span class="internal-link">Basuta</span> and <span class="internal-link">Aleppo</span> road such as <span class="internal-link">Al-Ashrafiyya</span> neighborhood and others.</p>
<p>In 1983, the new Afrin City Council was established instead of Afrin municipality in response to organizing the local administration law. The number of members of this council reached 20 members.</p>
<p>The city continues to grow and expand, followed by expansion in service centers such as fire departments, car garages, commercial centers, and government institutions.</p>
<p>The Afrin City Council is considered one of the most important councils belonging to Aleppo Governorate due to its large size.</p>
<p><strong><span class="internal-link">Afrin Market (Bazaar)</span></strong></p>
<p>Commercial markets are considered among the most important areas where people gather to meet their needs and exchange commercial goods. In the Afrin region, before 1927, the people of the region used to visit the <span class="internal-link">Kilis</span> commercial market in the <span class="internal-link">Mountain of the Kurds</span> district for shopping. After the <span class="internal-link">French mandate</span> over <span class="internal-link">Syria</span> and the transfer of <span class="internal-link">Kilis</span> city to <span class="internal-link">Turkey</span>, the remaining region was left without a market. After forming the district center in Afrin city, those responsible for district administration felt the need to establish a bazaar where people would gather. Near the old river bridge near the government house from the eastern side, a weekly market was established every Wednesday. <span class="internal-link">Mr. Jamil Ahmed Agha</span>, the municipality president, called for celebrating the establishment of this weekly bazaar, where joy celebrations were held with drums and dancing expressing the importance of the occasion. Due to the city&#x27;s expansion and the inability to accommodate and the magnitude of commercial exchanges, the market was moved to another location near the official Afrin secondary school west of the city.</p>
<p>This market is currently considered one of the most important commercial centers in the countryside of Aleppo Governorate, where agricultural products, especially olives, are displayed. Traders and people also visit it to meet their needs.</p>
<p>In 2001, due to the abundance of agricultural products, the city council decided to establish the <span class="internal-link">Hal Market</span> on the <span class="internal-link">Basuta</span> road east of the city. There are also small bazaars in the district centers in Rajo, <span class="internal-link">Bulbul</span>, and <span class="internal-link">Al-Hammam</span> village.</p>
<p>Among the holders of higher degrees in Afrin: <span class="internal-link">Ahmed al-Nasser</span> / Doctorate in Chemistry / <span class="internal-link">Britain</span> - <span class="internal-link">Hussein Habash</span> / Doctorate in Journalism / <span class="internal-link">Russia</span> - <span class="internal-link">Salah Manla Ali</span> / Doctorate in History / <span class="internal-link">Russia</span> - <span class="internal-link">Fawzi Rasoul</span> / Doctorate in Chemistry / <span class="internal-link">Germany</span> - <span class="internal-link">Fatih Baso</span> / Doctorate in Electrical Engineering / <span class="internal-link">Russia</span> - <span class="internal-link">Qader Arbo</span> / Doctorate in Meteorology / <span class="internal-link">Germany</span> - <span class="internal-link">Mohammed al-Khatib</span> / Doctorate in Agriculture / <span class="internal-link">Britain</span> - <span class="internal-link">Ahmed Sheikho</span> / Doctorate in General Surgery / <span class="internal-link">Romania</span></p>
<p>Village heads of Afrin city: <span class="internal-link">Mr. Abdul Hanan Bellal</span> / Head of <span class="internal-link">Mislon</span> neighborhood - <span class="internal-link">Mr. Ghazi al-Hamid</span> / Head of <span class="internal-link">Tishrin</span> neighborhood - <span class="internal-link">Mr. Ahmed Mohammed</span> / Head of <span class="internal-link">Adar</span> neighborhood - <span class="internal-link">Mr. Mohammed Amin Aybo</span> / Head of <span class="internal-link">Progress</span> neighborhood - <span class="internal-link">Mr. Imad al-Din Sheikho</span> / Head of <span class="internal-link">Unity</span> neighborhood - <span class="internal-link">Mr. Mahmoud Hussein al-Khalil</span> / Head of <span class="internal-link">Fida</span> neighborhood - <span class="internal-link">Mr. Faiq Ali</span> / Head of <span class="internal-link">Revolution</span> neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>According to the book <span class="internal-link">Mountain of the Kurds (Afrin)</span> Geographic Study by Dr. Mohammed Abdo Ali:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Afrin</strong>: It is the name of the <span class="internal-link">Afrin River</span>, given to the city after its establishment at the beginning of the twentieth century. We found the name &quot;Afrin&quot; in its current form in four historical sources from the <span class="internal-link">Islamic era</span>: <span class="internal-link">[History of Aleppo</span> – by <span class="internal-link">al-Uqaymi</span>, page of events of <span class="internal-link">478 AH</span>/<span class="internal-link">1085 AD</span>. And <span class="internal-link">Subh al-A&#x27;sha</span> by <span class="internal-link">al-Qalqashandi</span>, p.57. And <span class="internal-link">al-Durr al-Muntakhab</span> by <span class="internal-link">Ibn al-Shahna</span>, p.167. And <span class="internal-link">Dictionary of Countries</span> by <span class="internal-link">Yaqut al-Hamawi</span>, Part Two, p.180]. Thus, the oldest mention of the name &quot;Afrin&quot; in its current form dates back to <span class="internal-link">1085 AD</span>. However, none of those sources addressed the meaning and origin of the name &quot;Afrin&quot;. We will research here the origin and meaning of this name and mention most opinions regarding it:</li>
</ul>
<p>1- <strong>&quot;Afrin&quot; in Arabic dictionaries and sources:</strong></p>
<p>According to &quot;<span class="internal-link">Al-Qamus al-Wasit</span>&quot;, that &#x27;afar and &#x27;affar: means mixed it with what contradicts its color, and i&#x27;tafar al-shay&#x27;: meaning mixed it with dust. In the dictionary &quot;<span class="internal-link">Lisan al-Arab</span>&quot;: &#x27;ifrīn means &quot;corrupted&quot;, and it was said it is corruption. It was said for everything strong: layth &#x27;ifrīn.</p>
<p>As for <span class="internal-link">Khayr al-Din al-Asadi</span>, he says: the word Afrin means dust. He quotes from <span class="internal-link">Father Shalhat</span>: that it means dust, /Vol.5, p.413/, in <span class="internal-link">Abdullah al-Hulw</span>&#x27;s inquiries about this and he says: (Was the region distinguished by the abundance of its dust so it was named thus? The fact is that there is no other explanation, p.396). But it seems that <span class="internal-link">Mr. al-Hulw</span> does not know that the Afrin region is rich in water and forests, and dust is rarely stirred up in it.</p>
<p>2- <strong>Afrin in <span class="internal-link">Assyrian</span> and <span class="internal-link">Greek</span> texts:</strong></p>
<p>An <span class="internal-link">Assyrian</span> text dating to <span class="internal-link">876 BC</span> mentioned (that the <span class="internal-link">Aprie River</span> waters the <span class="internal-link">Patin</span> plain). The famous <span class="internal-link">Greek</span> historian &quot;<span class="internal-link">Strabo</span>&quot; also mentioned the name of the <span class="internal-link">Afrin River</span> in the same form &quot;<span class="internal-link">Aprie</span>&quot; in the first century <span class="internal-link">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Historians have agreed that the origin of the word <span class="internal-link">Apre</span> is from the <span class="internal-link">Lycian language</span>, one of the ancient <span class="internal-link">Indo-European languages</span> in <span class="internal-link">Anatolia</span>, and the basic form of the word is: <span class="internal-link">Eple</span>. As we know, the root <span class="internal-link">Ap-</span> in ancient <span class="internal-link">Aryan languages</span> including <span class="internal-link">Kurdish</span> means water. The Kurds according to their dialects replace the letter <span class="internal-link">p</span> with <span class="internal-link">v</span> so it becomes <span class="internal-link">Av</span>. The word remained in the <span class="internal-link">Indian subcontinent</span> in its old form in terms of pronunciation and meaning, and did not change, meaning &quot;water&quot;, and is pronounced as <span class="internal-link">Ab</span> or <span class="internal-link">Ap</span>, such as the name &quot;<span class="internal-link">Punjab</span>&quot; which consists of two syllables: <span class="internal-link">Pênc</span> five, and <span class="internal-link">Ap</span> water. Due to the absence of the letter <span class="internal-link">P</span> in <span class="internal-link">Arabic</span>, it is replaced by the letter &quot;<span class="internal-link">f</span>&quot; just as the letter <span class="internal-link">alif</span> is replaced by &quot;<span class="internal-link">ayn</span>&quot;, and thus the first syllable of that word becomes &quot;<span class="internal-link">af</span>&quot; instead of <span class="internal-link">Ap-</span>.</p>
<p>As for the syllable <span class="internal-link">re-</span>, it is the first syllable of the old <span class="internal-link">Kurdish</span> word &quot;<span class="internal-link">riwîn</span>&quot; <span class="internal-link">Riwîn</span> meaning &quot;the red earthy color&quot;. It is said <span class="internal-link">Bizina rwîn</span> &quot;the red earthy colored goat, or the one with red earthy ears&quot;, and it is also said <span class="internal-link">Ava riwîn</span> &quot;the red earthy colored water&quot;. By combining the two words: water <span class="internal-link">Av</span> and earthy color <span class="internal-link">Riwîn</span>, a new name is formed: <span class="internal-link">Avariwîn</span> or <span class="internal-link">Avriwîn</span> &quot;<span class="internal-link">Ava Riwîn</span> or <span class="internal-link">Afrwîn</span>&quot;, and as can be observed, it almost matches the form of the word &quot;Afrin&quot; in terms of structure, and means water with a red earthy color, which is a known characteristic of the <span class="internal-link">Afrin River</span> waters during its frequent floods. Elderly residents of the region in the northern villages still pronounce the name Afrin as &quot;<span class="internal-link">Afrân</span>&quot;, which is a word referring to the remains of grass, trees, and earthy-colored foam that float on the river surface during its flood.</p>
<p>If we take the root <span class="internal-link">-rê</span> or <span class="internal-link">-lê</span> with its other <span class="internal-link">Kurdish</span> meaning, i.e., &quot;stream, creek, road&quot;, the complete name would mean &quot;water stream or water creek&quot;.</p>
<p>3- **<span class="internal-link">Afirîn</span>: A <span class="internal-link">Kurdish</span> word meaning creation and giving. The <span class="internal-link">Afrin River</span>, with its flowing waters, was and still is a source of life and a spring of giving. Hundreds of prosperous villages spread along its banks, just as the ruins of dozens of cities, villages, and vanished fortresses lie along its banks. It is no wonder that the Kurds call the river the characteristic of &quot;life and fertility giver&quot; <span class="internal-link">Afirîn</span>, just as they call women &quot;<span class="internal-link">Afret</span>&quot; &quot;life creator&quot;.</p>
<p>Thus, whatever the meaning and source of the name, the ancestors of the Kurds from the <span class="internal-link">Hurrians</span>, and after them the <span class="internal-link">Hittites</span> and <span class="internal-link">Medes</span>, had a permanent presence in the <span class="internal-link">Taurus</span> regions in the period before and after <span class="internal-link">Christ</span>. Hundreds of <span class="internal-link">Kurdish</span> prosperous villages currently spread from its source to its mouth along the banks of the <span class="internal-link">Afrin River</span>. The Kurds and their ancient ancestors were permanent inhabitants of the entire <span class="internal-link">Afrin River</span> basin, and the river was known by them whether its name was <span class="internal-link">Aprie</span> or Afrin or <span class="internal-link">Afirîn</span>. However, despite this, knowing the origin of some ancient names remains an extremely difficult matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sources indicate that during the <span class="internal-link">Roman era</span>, a <span class="internal-link">Roman</span> &quot;fast&quot; road passed through the site of Afrin city. Excavations on both sides of the Jindires road street revealed massive carved archaeological stones and large pottery jars, indicating ancient settlement at the site. There were also several caves and caverns north of the old electricity company building, which were used in the past by travelers, as evidenced by the old metal coins that appeared on their floors.</li>
</ul>
<p>History books also mention that in the <span class="internal-link">Middle Ages</span> - around the fourteenth century <span class="internal-link">AD</span> - there was a bridge named &quot;<span class="internal-link">Qibar</span>&quot; at the city site. In the late <span class="internal-link">Ottoman era</span>, there were several inns for housing caravans and travelers north of the current bridge.</p>
<p>Afrin city currently consists of the following neighborhoods:</p>
<p><strong>The Old Town:</strong> Work began on constructing government buildings and civil administration offices such as the police station, prison, and palace at the beginning of the <span class="internal-link">French era</span>, and their construction was completed between 1925 and 1930. During their construction, the Jindires road street was established, and shops, commercial stores, and two small hotels were built on both sides.</p>
<p>The first inhabitants of the city were Kurds from <span class="internal-link">Karsan</span> village and some <span class="internal-link">Armenians</span> who sought refuge with the <span class="internal-link">French forces</span> to escape <span class="internal-link">Ottoman</span> persecution. Then some regional leaders joined in building residential houses, some regional wealthy families from <span class="internal-link">Al Ghabari</span>, <span class="internal-link">Sheikh Ismail</span>, <span class="internal-link">Sido Mimi</span>, <span class="internal-link">Ahmed Khalil Agha</span>, and <span class="internal-link">Darwish Agha</span>, leader of the <span class="internal-link">Yazidis</span>.</p>
<p>Afrin remained a small town until the late sixties of the twentieth century, and its few houses spread harmoniously and beautifully on the lower mountainous slope, mostly mud-brick and roofed with wood and single-story.</p>
<p>After that date, the town witnessed major urban expansion due to heavy local migration to it, and large new neighborhoods were formed, known popularly as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="internal-link">Al-Mahmoudiyya</span> neighborhood:</strong> In the northwest of the city, named after <span class="internal-link">Mahmoud Qadib al-Ban</span> as the first to build a house for living in it in the early seventies of the twentieth century.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="internal-link">Al-Zaydiyya</span> neighborhood:</strong> In the north, which is the old <span class="internal-link">Zaydiyya</span>, inhabited by farmers and agents affiliated with some <span class="internal-link">Aleppine</span> <span class="internal-link">Christian</span> families who had placed their hands with the help of <span class="internal-link">European</span> and <span class="internal-link">French</span> consulates on the adjacent plain of Afrin city from the west. This neighborhood extended north until it currently reached the summit of the <span class="internal-link">Xemrevîn</span> highland. The residents of this neighborhood are a mixture of Kurds, some <span class="internal-link">Arabs</span>, and <span class="internal-link">Circassians</span>. The name is attributed to the shrine of &quot;<span class="internal-link">Sheikh Zaid</span>&quot; located inside the <span class="internal-link">Zaydiyya</span> cemetery on the hilltop.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="internal-link">Al-Ashrafiyya</span> neighborhood:</strong> In the east, a new neighborhood located east of the river on the volcanic <span class="internal-link">Empêlk</span> plateau parallel to the <span class="internal-link">Afrin River</span> course. This neighborhood was established in the late sixties of the twentieth century, and its first resident was <span class="internal-link">Wehîdê Aşvan</span> &quot;<span class="internal-link">Wahid al-Tahhan</span>&quot; from <span class="internal-link">Kafr Batera</span> village, who had built a mill operating with diesel and a house for living there. The current <span class="internal-link">Al-Ashrafiyya</span> is a large neighborhood whose modest houses spread over the entire western slope of the <span class="internal-link">Empêlkê</span> highland. It is inhabited especially by migrants from the region&#x27;s villages, and most of them work in agricultural labor, and this neighborhood is considered the poverty belt of Afrin city.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="internal-link">Qaraci Gênco</span> neighborhood <span class="internal-link">Taxa Qeracî Gênco</span>:</strong> Located south of the city on the southern part of the <span class="internal-link">Empêlk</span> plateau, the neighborhood is named after the landowner &quot;<span class="internal-link">Kanjo Fio</span>&quot;, and some currently call it &quot;<span class="internal-link">Tarnda Road</span> neighborhood&quot; for its location on the old <span class="internal-link">Tarnda</span> village road. The first to build a house for living there was the cook &quot;<span class="internal-link">Horik</span>&quot; around 1970.</li>
</ul>
<p>The houses of this neighborhood spread on the western slope facing the <span class="internal-link">Afrin River</span>, taking a north-south extension and reaching <span class="internal-link">Tarnda</span> village, which was also annexed to the administrative boundaries of Afrin city.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="internal-link">Al-Bobna</span> neighborhood:</strong> A small street adjacent to the western bank of the <span class="internal-link">Afrin River</span> upon its arrival to the city. Most of its residents are <span class="internal-link">Arab Bobna</span>, and its location was a livestock market.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="internal-link">Al-Autoestrad</span> neighborhood:</strong> Located west of the city, a modern neighborhood built in beautiful and modern floors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Afrin city is the capital of the <span class="internal-link">Mountain of the Kurds</span> and the main center for its economic, social, and administrative activity. It is a beautiful and quiet city with a distinguished geographical location and pleasant climate. The <span class="internal-link">Syrian Geographic Dictionary</span> says about it that it is the most beautiful small city in <span class="internal-link">Syria</span>.</p>
<p>An important construction movement began in Afrin city in the last decade of the twentieth century, as multi-story buildings rose in it, and many good and diverse commercial stores were established. It currently has daily commercial markets for agricultural and animal products, in addition to the weekly Wednesday market and another livestock market.</p>
<p>The city and its surrounding areas have olive presses, factories for manufacturing tahini and soap, others for building materials and some food products, and a soft drinks factory whose establishment dates back to 1927. There are many carpentry, blacksmithing, machinery and vehicle repair shops, and others. It also has dozens of doctors and pharmacies, in addition to four private hospitals. Due to the settlement of tens of thousands of the region&#x27;s sons in <span class="internal-link">Aleppo</span>, there is constant and heavy transportation movement to and from it.</p>
<p>The population of Afrin city according to its municipality&#x27;s estimates in 2006 reached about 84,000 people.</p></div></details><hr class="themed-border"><details class="group" open><summary class="flex justify-between items-center font-semibold p-3 cursor-pointer text-lg"><span>III.

<p>The journey documents a trip to the city of Afrin and its surrounding villages, passing through the village of <span class="internal-link">Katakh</span> and by landmarks such as the olive press of Khalil Hissy Elo (Maqsala Xelîlê Hêsê Elo) and a gas station belonging to Hasti Osu in the village of Kozê (Gundê Kozê). Upon entering Afrin city through the Mahmoudiyah neighborhood, a significant historical and cultural site discussed is the Newroz Roundabout, which was formerly known as Dawar Azadi, or Freedom Roundabout. In the past, this roundabout was the site of a statue of Kawa the Blacksmith (Kawayê Hesinkar), a pivotal figure in Kurdish culture. The speaker notes that this statue is now gone, and the video shows its empty pedestal. The statue has since been replaced by a new monument depicting a globe with a dove, and a Syrian flag is now flown on a prominent flagpole in the square. The area around the roundabout has also seen changes on a smaller scale, with a tobacco shop, Markaz Sheikh Khalil, now located where a chicken restaurant named Matbakh Afrin once stood.</p></div></details></div>
